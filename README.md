# keyless-coding-challenge
Coding challenge from Keyless.io


## Assignment
Imagine that your first task once youâ€™ll join the Keyless team will be to 
design and implement a micro-service that acts as an encryption oracle.

Specifically, the micro-service should expose some REST APIs that allow 
the caller to encrypt a payload (provided as an input to the API) using AES-GCM.
The encrypted payload shall be returned as a response the user (as an output 
of the REST API), together with the AES encryption key used and to any 
additional information required.

The service should run within a Docker image/container and should follow best 
practices for REST APIs, micro-services, and secure software development. Bonus 
points if it ships with unit and integration tests.

Please take a moment to consider this task and try to implement 
the micro-service it describes. Then, within a few days from this message, 
zip the resulting implementation within a compressed archive and attach it 
to this mail. Feel free to also add any design specification or additional 
material that you have prepared.
